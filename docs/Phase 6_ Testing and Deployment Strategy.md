## Phase 7: Testing and Deployment Strategy

This phase outlines the testing and deployment strategies for the GoLang authentication and authorization RESTful API. Comprehensive testing ensures the reliability, security, and performance of the application, while a well-defined deployment strategy facilitates efficient and consistent deployment to production environments.

### 7.1 Testing Strategy

Testing will be conducted at multiple levels to ensure the quality and correctness of the API.

1.  **Unit Tests:**
    -   **Purpose:** To test individual functions, methods, and components in isolation.
    -   **Scope:** Business logic (services), utility functions (e.g., password hashing, JWT generation/parsing), and repository methods.
    -   **Tools:** Go's built-in `testing` package.
    -   **Best Practices:**
        -   Write tests for all critical paths and edge cases.
        -   Use mock objects or interfaces for external dependencies (e.g., database, Redis, email service) to ensure true isolation.
        -   Ensure high code coverage for core logic.

2.  **Integration Tests:**
    -   **Purpose:** To test the interaction between different components (e.g., handler-service-repository-database flow).
    -   **Scope:** API endpoints, database interactions, Redis interactions, and social OAuth flows.
    -   **Tools:** Go's `testing` package, `httptest` for HTTP requests, and potentially a test database (e.g., Dockerized PostgreSQL and Redis for testing).
    -   **Best Practices:**
        -   Use a clean test database for each test run to ensure repeatable results.
        -   Test full request-response cycles for API endpoints.
        -   Verify data persistence and retrieval.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
    -   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and test the entire application flow from client to server.
    -   **Scope:** Full authentication and authorization flows, including social logins and email verification.
    -   **Tools:** Could involve a separate testing framework or custom Go scripts that interact with the deployed API.
    -   **Best Practices:**
        -   Test critical user journeys.
        -   Ensure all components are working together correctly.

4.  **Security Testing:**
    -   **Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities and ensure the API is secure against common attacks.
    -   **Scope:** Authentication mechanisms, authorization checks, input validation, token handling.
    -   **Methods:** Manual penetration testing, automated security scanners, code reviews for security best practices.
    -   **Focus Areas:** JWT validation, password hashing, OAuth2 state parameter validation, rate limiting, email verification token validity.

### 7.2 Deployment Strategy

The API will be containerized using Docker for consistent and portable deployment across different environments. Kubernetes or a similar container orchestration platform is recommended for production deployment.

1.  **Dockerization:**
    -   A `Dockerfile` will be created to build a lightweight Docker image of the Go application.
    -   The Dockerfile will include steps for building the Go binary, copying necessary files, and setting up the entry point.
    -   **Example `Dockerfile`:**
        ```dockerfile
        # Use the official Golang image as a base image
        FROM golang:1.22-alpine AS builder

        # Set the current working directory inside the container
        WORKDIR /app

        # Copy go.mod and go.sum files and download dependencies
        COPY go.mod go.sum ./ 
        RUN go mod download

        # Copy the source code into the container
        COPY . .

        # Build the Go application
        RUN go build -o /go-auth-api ./cmd/api

        # Use a minimal image for the final stage
        FROM alpine:latest

        # Install ca-certificates for HTTPS connections
        RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

        # Set the current working directory inside the container
        WORKDIR /root/

        # Copy the built binary from the builder stage
        COPY --from=builder /go-auth-api .

        # Expose the port the application runs on
        EXPOSE 8080

        # Run the application
        CMD ["./go-auth-api"]
        ```

2.  **Environment Configuration:**
    -   All sensitive configurations (database credentials, API keys, JWT secrets, Redis connection details) will be managed via environment variables.
    -   For local development, a `.env` file can be used with `godotenv`.
    -   For production, environment variables will be injected by the deployment environment (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, Docker Compose `.env` files, CI/CD pipelines).

3.  **Database and Redis Setup:**
    -   PostgreSQL and Redis instances will be deployed separately from the Go application.
    -   For development, Docker Compose can be used to spin up local instances of PostgreSQL and Redis.
    -   For production, managed services (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL; AWS ElastiCache, Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis) are recommended for scalability, reliability, and ease of management.

4.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Conceptual):**
    -   Automate the build, test, and deployment process using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).
    -   **Steps:**
        -   **Code Commit:** Developer pushes code to the repository.
        -   **Build:** CI/CD pipeline triggers, builds the Docker image.
        -   **Test:** Runs unit and integration tests.
        -   **Image Push:** If tests pass, pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry).
        -   **Deployment:** Deploys the new image to the staging or production environment (e.g., using Kubernetes manifests or Docker Compose files).

5.  **Monitoring and Logging:**
    -   Integrate logging libraries (e.g., Go's `log` package, or a more advanced structured logger like `logrus` or `zap`) to capture application logs.
    -   Forward logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Grafana Loki, cloud logging services).
    -   Implement monitoring for API performance, error rates, and resource utilization (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana).

This comprehensive testing and deployment strategy ensures that the API is robust, secure, and ready for production use.
